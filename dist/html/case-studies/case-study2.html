            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              A serverless, progressive web application (PWA) built with React using test-driven development (TDD). The
              meet app uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events and displays event data in various forms.
            </p>
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>This project was created as a part of CareerFoundry’s Full-Stack Immersion Web Development program. With
              serverless and PWAs growing in popularity, these two concepts were the focus of this project as well as
              utilizing a TDD approach (writing tests before writing the app’s functionality). Lastly, adding graphs to
              the app was another aspect to learn further visualization techniques.

            <ul>
              <li>Filter events by city</li>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <h4>Client-Side</h4>
        <p>I created the Chat App using Expo for development and testing, React Native for frontend mobile device coding
          and Gifted Chat for designing the chat interface and functionality. Utilizing React Native’s ActionSheet, I
          coded the custom actions for user’s to send their location, take a photo, or send an image from their device’s
          library- via Expo’s ImagePicker & Location tools- and display it in the chat.
          The app can be used offline using React Native’s NetInfo and AsyncStorage (client-side storage) to view
          previous
          chat conversations.
        </p>
        <h4>Server-Side</h4>
        <p>An essential part of a modern chat application is its ability to store and save a user’s previous
          conversation,
          including any images shared. For this project, I utilized Google Cloud Firestore, a NoSQL document database
          designed for creating serverless and scalable apps. The app authenticates users anonymously via Google
          Firebase
          authentication. Chat conversations (data including message text, message & user ID, date, location, etc) and
          images are stored in Google Firestore Database. Messages and images, once sent, get simultaneously uploaded to
          the cloud storage- and accessed upon initial Chat screen opening.</p>

      <div class="container p-4" style="background-color: #b4a7d6">
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>While many aspects of this project were rather straightforward, a challenge for me came with developing the
          custom actions for users to send images and/or their location. One issue that arose was displaying the image
          or
          location map in the chat conversation while the other came from connecting both to the database for storage.
          With the help of an experienced developer and mentor, I was able to get out the kinks and gained greater
          insight
          into using both React Native and Google Firebase congruently with each other.</p>
        <h3>Duration</h3>
        <p>The development of testing and, by order of user stories, backend coding of this app occurred over four
          weeks. Frontend styling of the app was added towards the end along with the chart graphs.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container p-4" style="background-color: #f2a2a2">
        <h3>Summary & Future Steps</h3>
        <p>Beyond the initial challenges of learning React Native’s custom actions and understanding how to best connect
          a
          mobile app to a cloud database, the Chat App came out as expected and desired- a high-performing mobile chat
          app
          for users to send messages, photos and their location.
          Moving forward, I would like to redesign the app with a visual-centered approach including a logo and
          consistent
          branding. I enjoyed using Gifted Chat and look forward to further customizing the app beyond the initial
          guidelines given, such as stylistic alterations and including a profile photo option for the user. There is
          certainly a lot more to React Native and Gifted Chat to explore by reading through their documentation and I
          am
          eager to see what unique features I can add to make my app stand out from its competitors.
